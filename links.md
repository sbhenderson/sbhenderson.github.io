These are links to other blogs, channels, software, or sites that I have found interesting or useful to me.

## Blogs

- [Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski/) - absolutely incredible animations and detailed information about various natural phenomena.
- [Bits about Money](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/) - really enjoyed the posts about [gift cards](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/more-than-you-want-to-know-about-gift-cards/) and [BNPL](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/buy-now-pay-later/) but there are many excellent ones.
- [Raymond Chen/The Old New Thing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/) - Raymond is a prolific writer and has some really in-depth articles into the nature of software or Windows.

## YouTube

- [Jeff Geerling](https://www.youtube.com/@JeffGeerling) - has unique videos in the tech space and also has a [website](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/).
- [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEIwxahdLz7bap-VDs9h35A) - fascinating videos examining various natural phenomena.
- [Practical Engineering (Grady Hillhouse)](https://www.youtube.com/@PracticalEngineeringChannel) - great videos focusing on the very practical world of infrastructure around us. I really enjoyed details about projects that you may not have heard of otherwise including the New Harbor Bridge Project in Corpus Christi and the Washington Bridge in Rhode Island.

## Software

- [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) - creates an abstraction for you to send notifications to your personal devices
- [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) - pretty powerful multi-session remote manager.
- [ASCIIFlow](https://asciiflow.com/#/) - nice way to have imageless diagrams
- [pgloader](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader) - great way to transfer data and handle data type changes to PostgreSQL.
- [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) - nice alternative to Visio for diagramming needs.
- [Penpot](https://penpot.app/) - handy design and mockup tool comparable to Figma and similar
- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) - regardless of your opinion of Git UIs, sometimes, it's easier to visualize a graph than read `git log`. For me, you still need a grasp of the underlying commands, but it tremendously helps with getting the right arguments 99% of the time.

## Miscellaneous

- [Linuxserver Fleet](https://fleet.linuxserver.io/) - consistently designed images for software that may be relevant to people running their own homelab.
