These are links to other blogs, channels, software, or sites that I have found interesting or useful to me.

2. [Bits about Money](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/) - really enjoyed the posts about [gift cards](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/more-than-you-want-to-know-about-gift-cards/) and [BNPL](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/buy-now-pay-later/) but there are many excellent ones.

## Software
