These are links to other blogs, channels, software, or sites that I have found interesting or useful to me.

## Blogs

- [Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski/) - absolutely incredible animations and detailed information about various natural phenomena.
- [Bits about Money](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/) - really enjoyed the posts about [gift cards](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/more-than-you-want-to-know-about-gift-cards/) and [BNPL](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/buy-now-pay-later/) but there are many excellent ones.
- [Raymond Chen/The Old New Thing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/) - Raymond is a prolific writer and has some really in-depth articles into the nature of software or Windows.
- [In the Pipeline](https://www.science.org/blogs/pipeline) - There are some real gold nuggets in there especially the `Things I Won't Work With` series.

## YouTube

- [Jeff Geerling](https://www.youtube.com/@JeffGeerling) - has unique videos in the tech space and also has a [website](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/).
- [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEIwxahdLz7bap-VDs9h35A) - fascinating videos examining various natural phenomena.
- [Practical Engineering (Grady Hillhouse)](https://www.youtube.com/@PracticalEngineeringChannel) - great videos focusing on the very practical world of infrastructure around us. I really enjoyed details about projects that you may not have heard of otherwise including the New Harbor Bridge Project in Corpus Christi and the Washington Bridge in Rhode Island.
- [NileRed](https://www.youtube.com/nilered) - totally interesting perspective as someone from a chemistry-adjacent field.

## Software

### Paid Services

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - at least for the languages and IDEs/editors I use, this seems pretty solid without paying for the $200/mo offerings
- [Kagi](https://kagi.com) - solid search replacement and, of course, no sponsored or ad-infused listings. Very handy!
- [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com/) - solid budgeting and finance dashboarding app
- [GeForce Now](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/) - avoid buying a GPU when you can rent a GPU

### Paid Software

- [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) - creates an abstraction for you to send notifications to your personal devices
- [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) - pretty powerful multi-session remote manager.
- [Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/download) - solid diff/merge capability with continual improvements
- [Xyplorer](https://www.xyplorer.com/) - very different and unique way of approaching file exploration from the built-in Windows one. I thought this was most useful in the post-Clover but pre-Windows 11 23H2 tabbed experience.
- [DMDE](https://dmde.com/) - software is exceptional at helping recover data from failing (or failed) hard drives
- [IsoBuster](https://www.isobuster.com/) - software was invaluable for recovering home movies from DVDs that the person who was transferring from VHS did not properly finalize

### Free Software

- [ASCIIFlow](https://asciiflow.com/#/) - nice way to have imageless diagrams
- [pgloader](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader) - great way to transfer data and handle data type changes to PostgreSQL.
- [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) - nice alternative to Visio for diagramming needs.
- [Penpot](https://penpot.app/) - handy design and mockup tool comparable to Figma and similar
- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) - regardless of your opinion of Git UIs, sometimes, it's easier to visualize a graph than read `git log`. For me, you still need a grasp of the underlying commands, but it tremendously helps with getting the right arguments 99% of the time.
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) - password managers are a controversial topic it seems, but Bitwarden seems quite reasonable

## Miscellaneous

- [Linuxserver Fleet](https://fleet.linuxserver.io/) - consistently designed images for software that may be relevant to people running their own homelab.
