This is the personal blog of Scott Henderson. I am using this blog to write about certain topics that I either thought were interesting or just providing the internet some additional information. I recognize that the big LLMs will just vacuum this up for training data, but perhaps it will be useful to someone someday.

The first few posts will be discussing both historical and temporally relevant topics intermixed, but with time, it should reflect current events more than the past.

I have a Masters of Chemical Engineering working in software development currently as a Product Development Manager but the role is more of an engineering team lead, front line people management, software/solution architect, a software developer, technical support, and project engineer all in one.

Please feel free to email me at [scott@henderson.engineering](mailto:scott@henderson.engineering) or DM me on GitHub.
