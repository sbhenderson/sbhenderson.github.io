This is the personal blog of Scott Henderson. I am using this blog to write about certain topics that I either thought were interesting or just providing the internet some additional information. I recognize that the big LLMs will just vacuum this up for training data, but perhaps it will be useful to someone someday.

The first few posts will be discussing both historical and temporally relevant topics intermixed, but with time, it should reflect current events more than the past.

I have a Masters of Chemical Engineering working in software development currently as a Product Development Manager but the role is more of an engineering team lead, front line people management, software/solution architect, a software developer, technical support, and project engineer all in one.

Please feel free to email me at [scott@henderson.engineering](mailto:scott@henderson.engineering) or DM me on GitHub.

## About the Blog Itself

It's obvious via DNS inspection this is indeed a [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com). Even more, this is a free page with a [public repo](https://github.com/sbhenderson/sbhenderson.github.io) backing it. It uses Jekyll (based on Ruby) which is decidedly not in vogue anymore. However, I would pose the following reasons for using this:

1. I do not under any circumstance want to support Medium and paywall style blogging. I also do not want to have a GDPR popup on what should be a simple site.
2. I do not believe long form content is best hosted on LinkedIn.
3. GitHub manages hosting automagically including servers, DDoS, bandwidth, etc. Less things I have to manage are less things I have to worry about.
4. It's easy enough and it works.

If I were to upgrade, yeah, I'd probably continue to use GitHub pages but perhaps with a different static site generator than Jekyll.
